Connect Four is a classic two-player board game where the objective is to be the first player to connect a line of four discs of your color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally on a grid. Each player takes turns dropping one colored disc (traditionally red and yellow) into one of the columns at the top of the grid. The disc falls to the lowest available slot in the chosen column. The game continues until one player achieves a winning line of four connected discs or until the entire grid is filled without any winning moves, resulting in a draw.

In this GitHub repository, I have implemented a Connect Four game using object-oriented programming (OOP) in [insert programming language]. This implementation allows two players to play against each other on a customizable board with a specified target score and the number of connected discs required to win.

Features of the Connect Four project:
1. Two-player mode: The game supports a two-player mode where players can take turns dropping their discs on the board to compete against each other.
2. Target score: Players can set a target score, and the game will continue until one of the players reaches the specified score, declaring them as the winner.
3. Customizable board size: Users can specify the size of the game board, allowing for different grid dimensions to tailor the gameplay experience.
4. Customizable win condition: Players can specify the number of connected discs required to win the game, making it possible to adjust the difficulty or length of the matches.

With this Connect Four implementation, players can enjoy the timeless fun of the game while having the flexibility to personalize their gaming experience. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Connect Four player, this project offers an engaging and interactive way to challenge your strategic thinking and have a great time with friends and family. Check it out, and enjoy playing!
